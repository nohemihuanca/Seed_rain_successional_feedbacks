Data used are community matrices of the seed rain data in which each cell is the total number of all seeds of each species recorded in each trap in a plot, summed over the 24 monitoring months in a time period, separately for time periods 1997-1999 and 2015-2017 for a total of nine abundance community matrices. Presence and absence and abundance matrices were used respectively.
